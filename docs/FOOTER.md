## How is the list generated?

The list is updated by GitHub Actions daily.

https://github.com/khulnasoftproj/user-list/actions/workflows/update-list.yaml

The list is generated by searching the phrase `khulnasoftproj/khulnasoft-registry` with [GitHub Search Code API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search/search?apiVersion=2022-11-28#search-code) and getting each repository's GitHub Star count by [GitHub GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/graphql).

:warning: Note that this list isn't necessarily accurate.

- The list doesn't include repositories not using the Standard Registry [khulnasoftproj/khulnasoft-registry](https://github.com/khulnasoftproj/khulnasoft-registry)
- The list includes repositories that include the phrase `khulnasoftproj/khulnasoft-registry` in the code but don't use khulnasoft actually
